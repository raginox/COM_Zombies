BukkitDev page: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/call-duty-zombies

This repository is just the code base as maintained by smeths

You'll find the official repo by the original developer here:
https://github.com/Turkey2349/Call_Of_Minecraft-Zombies

For some time Turkey was gone from this project but he has come back and is working on a proper overhaul of the code, in the meantime, I'll release hotfixes for serious issues only if necessary, but long story short, welcome back Turkey!!
